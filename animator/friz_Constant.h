 * @class Constant
 * @brief A class that generates a single constant value for its duration. 
 *
 * Wait -- why would you need a constant value when you're trying to *animate*? 
 *
 * Consider this case: I have an an animation that's cyclic, and I want to be 
 * able to set it to run for some number of cycles that I don't know at compile 
 * time. An easy way to do this is to create an Animation object that has a 
 * `Constant` value in it, and in the `OnCompletion()` callback, check to see if 
 * that value is > 0 -- if not, immediately recreate the animation, but decrement
 * the constant loop count value.
